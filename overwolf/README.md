The code in this directory is meant to be ran inside the Overwolf extension environment such as the [Overwolf Sample App](https://github.com/overwolf/sample-app). 
The code in this directory was developed using code from the [Overwolf Sample App](https://github.com/overwolf/sample-app). Since no license has been specified by Overwolf, we unfortunately can't include the extensions complete code inside this repository.

In order to run the code inside this directory, follow these steps:

1. clone the Overwolf Sample App at the root level of this repository
2. move all files from this directory into the Overwolf Sample App (replace existing files)
3. delete this - now empty - directory
4. rename the Overwolf Sample App directory to 'overwolf'
